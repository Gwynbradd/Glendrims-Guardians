The Bazaar of Dura, the largest commercial district in Sharn, sprawls out across a dozen towers. The towers around the edges are devoted to shops and services. Almost anything can be found in this district, though the quality of any particular item or service cannot be guaranteed. At the center of the district, the open market from which the district takes its name presents a labyrinth of shops, tents, and makeshift stalls set up in the middle of the street.
