Rhukaan Draal is the capital city of Darguun. It is the seat of Darguun's leader Lhesh Haruuc and his clan the Rhukaan Taash. Rhukaan Draal is a sprawling goblinoid metropolis.

Most of the roads are bare earth and few of the technological wonders of the Five Nations are evident there.

The outer part of the city is a combination of tents, ramshackle huts, but further in there are houses build out of wood and stone, some of them having apparent signs of being rebuild in a Darguul style.

At the center of the city, dominating the skyline, is the palace fortress of Khaar Mbar'ost (Red House), the seat of power for Lhesh Haruuc. The ten-story building was commissioned from House Cannith.

The Bloody Market is a trade district in the city. The district gets its name from the often violent haggling that occurs between the goblinoids, though if blood is spilled the guards intervene to protect the merchants and not the patrons. While trading slaves is common elsewhere in Darguun, the practice was abolished in Rhukaan Draal.
