The stolen fortress formerly known as Veldarren.

The pass is blocked from side to side by a massive keep. The nearest side of the fortress appears to be a blank wall with a reinforced ramp leading up to a single gate that is wide enough for three wagons to drive through.

Behind the parapets of the fortress, towers rise atop so high that it almost looks like it had been built on top of the keep. There are also buttresses built between the fortress and the sides of the pass, almost looking like they had been added as an after thought.
