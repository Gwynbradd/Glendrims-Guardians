Valued Glendrim's Guardians,

In lieuof our amiable and profitable cooperation in the past, I feel it is my duty to inform you of a potential threat to some of your members that has recently come to my attention. One of our clients has expressed their willingness to offer a significant bounty to have some of your esteemed members taken care of. As you surely must understand, I am unable to disclose the identity of this client, but be assured that their resources are significant for this to cause a serious threat to your group.

What I can share however, is that we have reason to believe that due to the unwillingness of the Boromar Clan to take this contract, they may have tried to employ Daask for this task, though I do not have full confirmation of this yet.

Though you had dealings with Daask in the past, I remind you, of their ruthlessness and lack of concern for collateral damage. Perhaps in consideration of this threat, we could find a mutually beneficial agreement that ensures the safety and stability of our respective interests. Let us set aside any differences and unite in the face of adversity, working towards a resolution that safeguards our collective interests and secures a brighter future for both the Boromar Clan and Glendrim's Guardians.

Sincerely and respectfully,

Castar
