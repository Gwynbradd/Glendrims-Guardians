Ira,
I have to decline your request for additional resources. We are engaged in our own matters and cannot leave ourselves needlessly vulnerable to make up for your own poor planning. Alas, we have also not received orders to be of further assistance than what we have already provided. You may utilize the provided accommodations for a prolonged stay, should you require additional time to settle this matter. However, it leaves me wondering on your capabilities if you canâ€™t even deal with a measly adventuring.
Do not bother me again unless you have something to offer in return.
 
**C**
