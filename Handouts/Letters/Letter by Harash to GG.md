Esteemed Glendrim's Guardians,

It was an unexpected pleasure to receive your recent message, but it proved to be short-whiled. After all, you did not deem to pay us a visit despite my well-meaning invitation. To prove our goodwill, I will repeat once more: Come to Shamukaar and let us exchange words. I guarantee safe passage for the entirety of your visit.

If you are still not convinced, let me further motivate you. Besides the courier before you, we have picked up 24 urchins that had to struggle on the rough alleys of lower Sharn and provided them with a safe place where they will be taken care of. Unfortunately though, we will see ourselves forced to release one of them from our care with each passing hour past noon today.

With great anticipation, we await the arrival of your most distinguished company.

Harash
