Dearest Glendrim,

Your unexpected reappearence in Sharn has come to our attention. Truth be told, we had not expected you back in the City of Towers given your dramatic exit and the lengthiness of your absence.

Regardless, your recent actions have piqued our interest and so have your outstanding debts. Join us at the Tooth and Nail on morrowâ€™s sunset to reconnect with a liason of your old friends of the Boromar Clan and hopefully come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Please bring that crew of yours as well..

With Fondness,

Ilya Boromar

P.S.: Given your infamous tardiness, I sincerely recommend punctuality in this matter.
