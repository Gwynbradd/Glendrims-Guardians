Dear Glendrim's Guardians,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits, and that you have enjoyed your new residence at the Griffon's Roost. It is with great pleasure that I write to you today to express my deepest gratitude for your timely intervention with the darkest chapter of my life. Be assured that I am forever grateful for the compassion you have showed me.

I am delighted to inform you that I have undergone an almost transformative experience at the Kalashtar monastery, whose meditative practices helped immensely against nightmares that plagued me. Under the compassionate guidance of Nevitash, a stern yet remarkably helpful mentor, I have been able to find solace and healing in the depths of my troubled mind, though I understand that this had external causes. Through rigorous self-reflection and the practice of mindfulness, I have gained a newfound sense of peace and tranquility even after having encountered troubled sleep.

It is with this renewed sense of well-being that I have made the decision to move back to the comforting embrace of my dear sister Nancy, and her family, in the Pegasus Spire. I firmly believe that being surrounded by loved ones will provide me with the necessary support and stability to make up for my deeds and find new purpose in my life. For now, I shall focus my time on the up-bringing of hippogriffs and griffons, as that has always provided me with joy. I am considering to implement a program, where children from Dura get the opportunity to meet the young ones on a weekly basis, to ensure proper socialization of them at an early stage.

Please extend my heartfelt appreciation to each member of Glendrim's Guardians. Each of you played an integral role in my recovery, and I am forever indebted to your kindness and selflessness. I hope that you come and visit me at the Pegasus Spire when you find the time.

May the blessings of Balinor be ever-present in your lives, and may our paths cross again under brighter circumstances. Until then, know that you hold a special place in my heart.

With utmost gratitude and warmest regards,

Darian
