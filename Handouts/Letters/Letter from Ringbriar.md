Dear Guardians,

We cannot thank you enough for your aid in the dark times that fell upon the good people of Ringbriar.

Blessedly, everyone has recovered from their ordeal, and the village has come together to support Sally's wife Ruth in her grief.

It may be that Ballinor himself is now smiling upon our little community for what we have endured: James encountered a giant snail with a rainbow colored shell that leaves behind a trail of fine glass. What a remarkable discovery!

I don't need to tell you how expensive glass is to come by, and now all we need to do is herd this snail and carefully cut and collect the trail it leaves behind. The villagers have come to endearingly call it Pearl and observed that it has a particular taste for rocks and crystals.

As it turned out, we were able to adjust one of charcoal ovens to help reheat the glass and are figuring out on how we can best work with this material. Piotr took easily to it, already forming fantastical shapes and staining the glass in wondrous colors. Please find with this package a small figurine he made in thanks for his rescue.

Though I do have some ill tidings to share as well: Some travelers came through that reported more dangers north of the Skyraker forests, perhaps similar to what we had to endure. They told us that travelers and a whole merchant caravan have not returned from their travel to Graywall. We are praying to Boldrei to keep our village safe from whatever plagues these areas.

Again in deepest thanks,

Logan and the people of Ringbriar.

May the Sovereigns bless your travels.
