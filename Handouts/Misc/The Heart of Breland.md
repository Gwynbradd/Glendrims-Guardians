**The Heart of Breland**

(Verse 1)
In the heart of Breland, where the towers rise,
Sharn's silhouette, bright against the rainy skies,
A web of bridges against the spires tall,
Buzzling bazaar invites us all.

(Chorus)
Everbright lanterns light the bustling streets,
Bones of history, where past and present meets,
Through the gate of towers, ambitions are crowned,
In its stumbling depths, our truths are found.

(Verse 2)
Deep down in Ashblack, where the forges blaze,
The workers toil, through the smoky haze,
With hearts resilient, and spirits keen,
They craft the future, in the city of dreams.

(Chorus)
Everbright lanterns light the bustling streets,
Bones of history, where past and present meets,
Through the gate of towers, ambitions are crowned,
In its stumbling depths, our truths are found.

(Bridge)
Eyes reflecting, the city's myriad lights,
Sharn's spirit, in the skyward flights,
A mirror of progress, with edges that gleam,
Even at the base of its towers, the wretched still dream.

(Verse 3)
From the Cogs to Skyway, where contrasts collide,
Across the chasms, the proud hippogriffs ride,
Their shields are honor, their resolve of steel,
In the city's light, their purpose reveal.

(Chorus)
Everbright lanterns light the bustling streets,
Bones of history, where past and present meets,
Through the gate of towers, ambitions are crowned,
In its stumbling depths, our truths are found.

(Outro)
So raise your tankards, let your dreams be bold,
In Sharn's embrace, let your destiny unfold,
For in its vast circles, our fates are entwined,
In the eyes of the world, our paths aligned.
