Laws of Sharn

CRIMES OF AGGRESSION

Some of the most serious crimes under the law are those actions that bring direct, physical harm to another person.

Assault and Battery: This is usually marked on identification papers and fined 5 sp for each assault charge shown on his papers. Finally he is escorted out of the district and ordered to stay away for at least one day. If the character doesn’t have gold or identification papers, he is taken to the local garrison and assigned to labor detail.

Armed Assault: The fine increases to 10 gp per offense, and a character with three or more marks on his record may be sent to the garrison and held for trial. Confiscation of weapons is common.

Assaulting an Officer: The captive is usually held for trial.

Murder: Murder—the theft of life—is a serious offense. A murderer who is taken by the Watch is held for trial, and execution is certainly a possible punishment. Self-defense is a strong mitigating factor.

Dueling: The Sharn Watch considers duels to be assault with two guilty parties, potentially armed assault or even murder depending on the nature of the duel and whether it is interrupted in time.

CRIMES OF DECEPTION

Deception is stock in trade for criminals, almost a prerequisite for any other sort of crime. In some cases, however, the deception itself is the crime.

Forgery: Counterfeit coins and false identification papers are the most common forms of forgery, but there are many others. Punishment depends on the severity of the offense, between confiscation and fine to holding a trial.

Fraud: Technically, fraud is “deliberate deception with the intent to cause injury to another.” This covers a wide array of crimes, from oath breaking to selling false goods to what the Galifar Code of Justice calls “Counterfeit of Identity with Criminal Intent”.

Cases of fraud generally need to be resolved in court; fines, branding, or exile are the usual punishments.

Slander: Currently, slander is not a crime under the Galifar Code of Justice.

CRIMES OF PROPERTY

It is far more common for criminals to steal, harm, or smuggle property than people. Crimes of property are both more common in the city and less serious under the law.

Theft: For minor offenses where the stolen property is returned, the thief must pay the victim twice the value of what he stole. If the item cannot be returned, the fine may rise as high as ten times the value of the item that was lost, with hard labor if the fine cannot be paid. Branding and exile are common punishments for repeat offenders.

Smuggling and Contraband: Characters who sell or possess prohibited goods can find themselves in trouble with the law. Typically, contraband goods are confiscated and the criminal is ordered to pay a fine of up to twice the value of the contraband. Large smuggling operations may result in greater fines, along with branding and exile.

Treasure Hunting: Under the Galifar Code of Justice, it is illegal to plunder and sell the relics of past civilizations for personal gain.

There are a few ways that adventurers can avoid having their hard-won treasures confiscated. If they wish to work within the law, they can purchase a letter of marque from the Wharf Watch. A letter of marque costs 500 gp and lasts for one year. A letter of marque covers a single region, such as Breland or Xen’drik. These can be covered by a patron.

MISUSE OF MAGIC

The Galifar Code of Justice includes strict guidelines for the use of magic, as laid down by the Arcane Congress in ages past. These include the following:

Use of any spell that can inflict physical harm on another being—from magic missile to finger of death—is considered to be armed assault. This includes spells that permanently incapacitate a target, such as flesh to stone. Careless use of fire magic is treated especially harshly, due to the significant threat of property damage. If a summon spell conjures a dangerous creature that harms another person, the conjurer is liable for the actions of the beast.

Spells that incapacitate a target—such as sleep— are treated as simple assault.

Spells that tamper with the thoughts of another being—charm person, suggestion, fear—are considered to be a form of fraud.

TREASON

The accusation of treason against the Brelish Crown or the city of Sharn is a serious matter. The Guardians of the Gate handle the investigation of treason, and the King’s Citadel generally becomes involved if the accusation is serious. Treasonous behavior can include:

• Conspiracy to harm a city official or member of the Brelish Parliament or Royal Court.

• Conspiracy to steal or damage property of the Crown or the government of Sharn.

• Espionage on behalf of a foreign government.

While these are the most common categories, the agents of the King’s Citadel can extend the umbrella of treason to cover any activity they see as threatening the security of Breland. Crimes of Treason are tried under the authority of the King’s Citadel, without access to a jury. Depending on the magnitude of the crime, treason can result in exile, indefinite imprisonment, or even execution.

LOCAL LAWS

Occasionally individual districts or wards have their own laws. Upper Tavick’s Landing has a substantial set of local laws, described below:

- Carrying a weapon requires a license. Unauthorized weapons are confiscated.
- Casting a spell requires a license for that specific spell. Unauthorized spellcasting generally results in a fine of 50 gp times the level of the spell.
- Upper Tavick’s Landing has a dress code. Inhabitants must dress “in a manner that upholds the solemn dignity of this proud ward,”. Armor is usually considered to be inappropriate unless the wearer is part of the Watch, House Deneith, or another branch of the city government or the crown. Anyone held to be in contempt of this law is escorted from the district and ordered to stay away until rectifying the situation.
- Unruly conduct—fighting, shouting in the streets, and other forms of rude behavior—results in a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary expulsion from the ward (assuming that none of the other laws of the city were broken during the incident).
