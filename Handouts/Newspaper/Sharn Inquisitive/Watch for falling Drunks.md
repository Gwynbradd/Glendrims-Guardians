WATCH FOR FALLING DRUNKS

Just this week a Brelish woman in Middle Central was squashed to death when a drunk Cyran man fell on her from the upper wards. He survived. A good Brelish woman, a veteran of the Last War, cushioned his fall!

This incident isnâ€™t the first of its kind. Last month a clumsy warforged crushed two innocent halfling lovers. Before that, a shifter thief fell from a tower, injuring an unsuspecting griffon. I propose a new law: No traveling the middle or upper wards without a feather token. These affordable trinkets are all that stand between our safety and death caused by some rat who would rather spend gold on drink.
