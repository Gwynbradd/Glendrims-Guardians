Voice of Breland

IS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE HANDS OF OUR ENEMIES?

Since the Treaty of Thronehold Warforged have been emancipated as equals. Since then they have flocked into Brelish cities. In Sharn, High Walls alone suffers more Warforged than all of Karrnath has allowed to enter its borders. The Sharn Inquisitive and Korranberg Chronicles lament in an endless litany the poor treatment of Warforged, including overcrowding, unsafe working conditions and general animosity towards them. They fail to mention that we invited machinesÂ  into our midst, who were solely created for war and somehow these Warforged are expected to suddenly abandon their ingrained doctrine to live a peaceful life among us?

We Brelish are gladly compassionate to the truly innocent, but let us not forget that many of these machines once mindlessly fought for our enemies and could be used that way again. And while there may be a merit to their labor among the forges of Ashblack and Blackbones, our compassion is now stretched thin when House Orien recently announced the employment of Warforged for the maintenance and security of the Lightning Rail.

Good people of Breland, can we truly entrust parts of our most important infrastructure, that transports hundreds of women and children every single day, to former machines of war? Should we leave a blind eye as we open ourselves up to sabotage? The Voice of Breland will continue to ask the important questions that other newspapers choose to neglect.
