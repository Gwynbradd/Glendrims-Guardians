SAVAGES OF DARGUUN ATTEMPT TO RAID PEACEFUL KENNRUN

The border city of Kennrun was cravenly attacked by a host of Goblinoid savages from Darguun in the night from the 20th to 21st Olarune. The patriots of the Kennrun watch stood vigilant and forced the raiders back despite being attacked in the middle of the night, while all fires laid by the invaders could be extinguished through the hard work of the Kennrun firefighters before they could cause catastrophic damages to the city.

That the Goblinoids of Darguun can only be trusted as far as one can throw them history has shown time and time again. After all they abandoned their contracts on behalf of Cyre and instead stole the Cyran territory for themselves. At the Voice of Breland we have always cautioned against peace with Darguun as it will only last until this nation of mercenaries sets their eye on the next price.

Can Breland truly be safe with a country as vicious as Darguun right at our boarder? A nation that does not even know the structure of a family and openly worships the Dark Six. The only thing they understand is violence and so we urge that only a show of force will stop future attacks from happening. Let us act now and decidedly before they can launch more attacks where the Brelish families and soldiers near our border may not get off as lightly next time.
