DIPLOMATIC CRISIS IMMINENT AFTER UNPROVOKED RAID ON KENNRUN

An attempted raid by Darguul forces on the border town of Kennrun was conducted during the night of the 20th Olarune. The attackers could be turned back due to a fortunately timed training maneuver by the King's Citadel within the region that bolstered the local force significantly.

Despite the additional forces there had still been heavy fighting with loses on both sides until the Brelish forces finally could gain an advantage thanks to their fortified position and harried the raiders back towards the Seawall mountains. Attempts to lay fire to buildings were successfully thwarted and the overall damage to the town itself was blessedly kept to a minimum. Eyewitnesses reported strange formations by the Darguul raiders that proved to be very effective.

At this point, there has not been any formal response or declaration from Rhuukan Draal so it is unclear if this was part of a coordinated attack or individual clans acting on their own. No matter what, this situation will prove difficult to resolve peacefully through diplomacy. Already there are protests in Brelish cities asking for retaliation while Kennrun itself has seen a violent pogrom against its Goblinoid population culminating in multiple deaths as well as the temporary internment of the remaining Goblinoids within a closed of district of the town.

This recent attack further adds to existing concerns within the Brelish parliament regarding the growing challenges that are facing Eastern Breland. The Cyran prince Oargev ir'Wynarn has been stoutly opposing the recent legislation that would introduce a population cap for Cyran refugees coming to the new town of New Cyre, while rumors of plans of a Cyran secession run rampant. At the same time, troubles of roving bandits as well as monsters escaping the Mournlands have plagued the region all the while parliament has been slow in deciding on reinforcing the Eastern Command.

And while King Boranel ir'Wynarn is well loved in Breland among the common folk, his stout age of 75 raises concerns as none of his heirs have displayed similar bravery, conviction, or leadership to match, nor have they earned similar support within the populace. But clear leadership will be in dire need to navigate the largest diplomatic crisis since the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold.
