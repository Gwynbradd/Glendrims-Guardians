Mentor of Amber.
Grumpy, old looking fellow, despite only being in his forties. Though he is a knight of the Silver Flame, he may not be their most shining example when it comes to outward appearance.
Cobin has a dry humor and a harsh sense of honesty but is open minded to discussions on other points of views though they can quickly become heated.
