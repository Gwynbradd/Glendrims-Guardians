Gremat the 'Grubber,' a halfling of the Boramar syndicate, is as notorious in the underbelly of Sharn as the towers are high. Standing at a modest height of three feet and two inches, Gremat has a slight build that belies his tenacious spirit. His skin is tanned and leathery, a tapestry of his life's trials and tribulations in the streets. With a mop of unruly, sun-kissed hair that flops over one eye, he often appears disarmingly boyish, a trait he has learned to exploit to his advantage.

His moniker, 'Grubber,' is well-earned and widely known; Gremat has a particular knack for extracting coin from the pockets of the rich and the poor alike, with a beguiling grin and a tale of woe that could soften the hardest hearts. However, behind that impish smile lies a shrewd mind and avaricious eyes that constantly scan his surroundings for the next opportunity or mark.

Gremat's attire is an eclectic collection of mismatched garments — a vest pocketed to the brim with all manner of trinkets and coins, threadbare breeches patched multiple times over, and a pair of boots that have been re-soled more times than he cares to remember. Around his neck hangs a chain, at the end of which dangles a single, ornate die — a symbol of his belief in luck, though he ensures the odds are usually in his favor.

In his role within the Boramar clan, Gremat isn't just a common thug; he's a loan shark, a collector of debts, and a distributor of illicit funds. His nimble fingers are as adept at sleight of hand as they are at flicking a dagger's blade when necessary. Yet, there is a code he adheres to, a sense of honor among thieves that keeps him from the darkest paths of villainy.

After leaving House Medani behind, Glendrim's life took a sharp turn for the worse. Glendrim struggled to find his place in the bustling metropolis of Sharn. His youth was marked by a touching yet troubled search of a place of belonging, which unfortunately led him down less than savory paths. In Gremat the 'Grubber', Glendrim found an unexpected figure resembling, in some distorted manner, the mentor he never had. Gremat, notorious for his role in the Boramar syndicate and known for his relentless grubbing for coin, recognized a kindred spirit in the wayward youth. To the halfling, Glendrim was a project, a raw talent that, with the right guidance, could grow to be a valuable asset. To Glendrim, Gremat became a lighthouse in the chaotic storm of his life.

One might say it was Gremat's keen eye for exploitation that first drew him to Glendrim, yet over time, something shifted. In the half-elf's struggles, his moments of despair and flashes of unbridled courage, the halfling began to see echoes of his own long-forgotten ideals. Gremat found himself offering advice not solely rooted in self-interest but in a genuine desire to see Glendrim rise above the mire of his circumstances.

Their connection deepened when Gremat, in a rare moment of vulnerability, shared tales of his own youth — a time when he, too, had been lost and looking for a place to belong. Their bond transcended the usual debtor and debt-collector dynamic, becoming something more profound. Gremat saw potential in Glendrim not just as a tool for his own gain but as a young man with the capacity to perhaps break the cycle of exploitation that the syndicate so often perpetuated.

Glendrim's adventures with his party further complicated the narrative. His encounters with danger, his brushes with greatness, and his small but significant triumphs reached Gremat's ears, often leaving the halfling with a mixed sense of pride and concern. With each tale, the ledger that Gremat carried grew heavier, not with the weight of debts but with the weight of what might become of Glendrim.

In the quiet hours, when the city's clamor dims and the shadows grow long, Gremat finds himself hoping that Glendrim will do more than survive — that he will thrive and find the sense of belonging that has always eluded them both. And in those moments, the halfling grubber of coins allows himself the luxury of a sentiment he thought he'd long since lost — hope for someone else's future.
