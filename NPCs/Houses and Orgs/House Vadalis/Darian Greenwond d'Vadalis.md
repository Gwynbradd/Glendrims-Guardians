Reclusive high-standing member of House Vadalis. Used to reside in his estate in the Dragonwood Forest.
The group stopped him from creating terrible monsters and releasing them into western Breland in the hopes of stopping a Droamite invasion. The Guardians figured out the Quori influence and aided Darian in Sharn to overcome his nightmares by aid of the Kalashtar community in Overlook.
Gifted the group his old Sharn residence, the Griffon's Roost in thanks.
